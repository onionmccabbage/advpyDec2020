Python Database Review Exercise see https://pastebin.com/4pdXrRxG
=============================== until break at 2:20 then a bit after as well
Write code (in modules/packages as you choose) which creates a database containing a table to store data related to a zoo
Each animal in the zoo needs fields for 'animal_type', 'quantity' and 'maintenance_cost' along with a unique identifier
(You will only need to run the database and table code once)
Retrieve 'animals.json' and use it's members to iteratively populate the database

Ask the user for new 'animal_type', 'quantity' and 'maintenance_cost' and validate these before committing them to the table
(type is a non empty string, quantity is a non-negative integer and cost is a positive float)

Provide a user-driven set of choices to
- add new animals to the zoo
- update an existing animal (e.g. change quantity or maintenance cost)
- delete an animal from the database
- retrieve animals which match user criteria (such as type, quantiy, cost, 'begins-with' etc)

see https://www.w3schools.com/sql/

Optional
========
Make sure the animal table id is both unique and auto incremented
Write a module to retrieve all the current data from the database into one Python structure
(You could write an 'Animal' class and the populate a collection with instances of this class)
Pickle this structure (of all animals) and write it out to a byte file
Also convert the structure to json and write the json to a file
Write code which clears the database of all existing data then re-populates it from either the pickled file or the json file
Document your classes and methods
Write a simple doctest for parts of your code
